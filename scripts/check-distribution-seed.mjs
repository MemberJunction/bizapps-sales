/**
 * Distribution gate — can a stranger install this app and get a working one?
 *
 * Ported from bizapps-forms, where both failures below were live and both were invisible from
 * inside: everything built, every test passed, and the app worked perfectly on the machine that
 * had run `mj sync push` by hand. Sales shipped in exactly that state until the seed migration
 * landed — 22 metadata directories, none of which reached an installed host.
 *
 * CHECK 1 — THE METADATA SEED EXISTS AND IS CURRENT.
 *   `mj-app.json`'s `metadata.directory` is documentation: MJ's manifest schema says the install
 *   engine NEVER reads it, and seeding happens exclusively through `migrations/`. So metadata that
 *   has not been pushed into a `*Metadata_Sync*.sql` migration ships nowhere. Sales' 22 directories
 *   — the two seeded pipelines and their stages, ten type tables, 15 queries, the actions, the
 *   remote operations and the application itself — went a whole build without one.
 *
 *   Currency is checked against a manifest of content hashes rather than by diffing git: a hash
 *   manifest answers the question that actually matters ("is the shipped seed current with the
 *   metadata?") rather than a proxy ("did both change in the same pull request?"), and it works on
 *   any checkout, including the shallow clones CI hands you.
 *
 *   Regenerate both together:  npm run seed:manifest   (after regenerating the seed migration)
 *
 * CHECK 2 — NO UNRESOLVABLE PLACEHOLDERS IN SHIPPED SQL.
 *   `mj migrate` builds Skyway's placeholder map from THIS repo's mj.config.cjs, but
 *   `mj app install` builds it from the HOST's (MJCLI's open-app-context.ts ->
 *   openApps.migrationPlaceholders). Only `${flyway:defaultSchema}` and `${mjSchema}` are supplied
 *   by the install engine itself. Skyway deliberately leaves an unknown `${...}` UNTOUCHED rather
 *   than failing, so a third placeholder does not error — it survives as a literal string into
 *   whatever SQL contained it. bizapps-forms had `${commonSchema}` do exactly that in two migrations,
 *   silently disabling the bizapps-common exclusion in five CodeGen sweeps.
 *
 * Read-only. No --fix. Exits non-zero on any violation. Node stdlib only, so it runs in CI
 * without an install step.
