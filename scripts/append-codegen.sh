# Append CodeGen's SQL output below the baseline migration's banner.
#
# WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A NOTE: the generated half of the baseline (entity/field metadata,
# base views, CRUD procs, permissions) is what makes a fresh `mj migrate` produce a WORKING database
# rather than bare tables. It has been lost once already by re-running CodeGen and forgetting this
# step, which is unrecoverable without another full rebuild.
#
# The migration is split at the CODEGEN OUTPUT banner: everything above it is hand-authored DDL and
# is preserved verbatim; everything below is replaced with the current CodeGen output.
#
# Usage: scripts/append-codegen.sh [migration-file]

# GUARD: CodeGen regenerates INCREMENTALLY. Run against a database whose entities are already

REFUSING: the incoming CodeGen output ($INCOMING_GENERATED lines) is less than half of what is
already below the banner ($EXISTING_GENERATED lines). That is what a partial/incremental CodeGen run
looks like, and appending it would drop the rest of the generated half.

If this is intentional, pass --force. Otherwise rebuild the database from zero and re-run CodeGen so
it regenerates everything:

    scripts/rebuild-db.sh && npm run mj:codegen && scripts/append-codegen.sh
EOF
    [[ "${2:-}" == "--force" ]] || exit 1
    echo "  (--force given; proceeding anyway)" >&2

# GUARD: A PARTIAL CODEGEN RUN PRODUCES A BASELINE THAT INSTALLS A BROKEN DATABASE.
#
# CodeGen creates entity metadata, base views, CRUD procs AND permissions per entity. A run that dies
# partway — a request timeout on one entity is enough — leaves the rest without permission rows, and
# the NEXT run has nothing to do for the entities that already exist, so it never emits them. The
# appended SQL is then silently short: every table is there, every view is there, and two entities
# refuse every read with "does not have read permissions" the first time anybody touches them.
#
# That has happened once (Price List Assignments and Stored Value Transactions, after a 120s timeout
# creating StoredValueTransaction). The suite caught it, but only because those two entities happened
# to be on a covered path. Asking the database directly is cheap and catches it every time.

REFUSING: $ORPHANS entity/entities in __mj_BizAppsSales have NO EntityPermission rows.

That is what a CodeGen run that died partway looks like. Appending now would bake a baseline that
installs a database whose reads fail for those entities. Re-run the whole cycle so CodeGen
regenerates from zero:

    scripts/rebuild-db.sh && npm run mj:codegen && scripts/append-codegen.sh
